# Railway Reservation System (C++)

An *Advanced Railway Reservation System* built using *C++*, applying core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, STL containers, polymorphism, inheritance, and file handling.

## Features

- Book tickets with dynamic fare calculation
- Discount for senior citizens
- View all ticket reservations
- Cancel bookings by Ticket ID
- Choose from a list of real Indian trains
- Data persistence using file storage (reservations.txt)

## Concepts Used

- *Classes & Objects* – Train, Passenger, Ticket
- *Inheritance* – NormalPassenger, SeniorCitizenPassenger
- *Polymorphism* – Fare logic overridden for categories
- *STL* – vector, map for managing data
- *File Handling* – Stores/resumes bookings on file

## Technologies

- Language: *C++*
- Tools: GCC / G++ Compiler, Code:: VS Code
